# TRITCH - The Social Travel Planner App

Tritch is a travel itinerary application that allows users to create, share, and follow the itineraries of fellow users.

# Main Technologies Used
Javascript, MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NodeJs, jsonwebtoken, fullcalendar, bcrypt, axios, joi, mongoose, HTML, CSS
APIs: RoadGoat, Google Maps, Google Places, Google Geocoding API
Both the frontend and backend servers are hosted on Heroku.

# Approach Taken
This is a group project between 3 people, Julian, Kharthik, and Zheng Han.
Responsibility for the development of the app was split by functionality (e.g. users, itineraries, bucketlist, following, comments) as opposed to splitting the development responsibility by backend/frontend.

# Development Process
The team first met to discuss the functionality that we would like to have in the application. We then discussed each functionality in detail to translate the functional requirements into technical specifications. After getting the technical specifications, the team worked on the backend and tested the routes before we discussed the integration of the frontend.

We worked together via Zoom a lot to debug the issues that we faced, which helped a lot in letting us understand each other's code and POVs. 

# Challenges faced
Difficult working wih multiple users - different people different styles of coding
Pushing to prod from Heroku was difficult

# Things to work on
Fix some of the features on the front-end
Beautify the UI of the application
